# Documentation on my first week in Finch Scoradia as an intent
    DAY 1
    I learnt the basics of project management and it's basics concepts which are
     1) Project-which is a temporal objective to profer a unique solution
     2) Poject cycle- which are different stages or processes of project management they are:
        a) initation-For initiation process group, you have 2 important processes;
           i)Project charter- This  is a fairly simple document outlining a few thingsit would include
             my objectives, scope, rough idea for the cost and time, key stakeholders and milestones.
           ii)Stakeholders identifiction-At this stage, you will again keep it very simple. You will not categorize all the stakeholder based on their influence it includes the Sponsors.
        b)Planning-Planning is a lot more detailed and comprehensive than initiation
          we are looking to find answers to 3 main questions;

           What are we going to do?

           How are we going to do it?

           How to know when the project is done? 
            So, it’ll include; requirements, and scope.

            Work Breakdown Structure (or as we call it WBS)
         c)Execution-The purpose of the executing process is to complete work we defined in the project management plan and meet the
          project objectives or in a Gantt chart,Gantt chart is a very easy way to list activities or work packages in a suitable
          timescale. Each work package or activity is represented by a bar and the position and length of the bar show us the start,
          duration, and end date of the activity.
         d) Management and Controlling-Monitoring and controlling means measuring the performance of your project against the plan, your change requests, and making sure you are hitting your KPIs if you have included them in the plan.
         e) Closing-So, what do we do now?
           Well, what you do is really customizable to the needs and complexity of your project. But in general, these are 
           good starting points.

        One; We hand it over to the client if it’s a project you did for a client. You need to basically get a sign-off
            from the client.
        Two; Finish procurements. Meaning, you need to make the final payments and complete your cost records.
        Three; Gather your final lessons learned. This is basically documenting what went wrong and what 
              did we learn from it.    
        Four; You release resources, let your team members go back to their own teams.
        five; finally… You're done.
        
       
    Day2
         I used two major collaborative tools for project management which are trello and quire in practicising project management in
         these tools are more like gantt chart where you assigning tasks and time of execution
         
    Day3
         I learnt how to design responsive you UI's with  flutter reusable widgets from a forked repository  in github 
         a) Flutter screens 
         b) liqiud swipes 
         c) flutter awesome widgets 
         d) flutter UI templates 
         e) flutter widgets 
    Day4 
        I learnt flutter with Firebase Cloud Firebase
        Androd firebase set up
        Firebase flutter packages setup
        Registration and authentication with firebase
        Saving data into Firebase store
        Listening to data from firebase store
   Day5
       State management and  Documentation
       
       
       
       
       
       
  # Week 2
  Day 1
   I read this book- Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman where i learnt and understood the meaning of apprenticeship (The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing) and Apprenticeship pattern (An apprenticeship pattern attempts to offer guidance to someone working with the craft model on the ways in which they can improve the progress of their career.) .
   Day 2
   I learnt the principles  or guidance of acheiving a good software Craftman through various pattern lists-
   A Different Road: You have discovered that the direction you want to go is different from the path toward software craftsmanship.

Be the Worst: In a team of experienced craftmen or even your fellow apprentice swallow your pride and create and enviroment to learn new things from them .

Breakable Toys: You  create projects of your own while learning so  that you would be able to learn from your own experience.

Concrete Skills: You want to work on a great development team, yet you have very little practical experience make sure you find a way to contribute to the team with your little expenrience and also Be the Worst.

Confront Your Ignorance: You have discovered wide gaps in your knowledge, and your work requires that you understand these topics?
know the skills you need and learn it  and fill in the gaps
Craft over Art: You need to deliver a solution for your customer. Deliver the exact solution your customer require. use your breakable toys to try new things.

Create Feedback Loops: You can’t tell if you’re suffering from “unconscious incompetence.” Learn to ask for feedbacks from your team mates to know your gaps and fill it.

Dig Deeper: If you need to learn a tool don't do surface learning learn it deeply to avoid upront obstacles

Draw Your Own Map: None of the career paths that your employer provides is a fit for you. you should be able to know what fits you and draw your map and follow it

Expand Your Bandwidth: Your understanding of software development is narrow and focused only on the low-level details of what you’ve worked on in your day job? expand your knowledge by learning new tools.

Expose Your Ignorance: You have discovered wide gaps in your knowledge and are afraid that people will think that you don’t know what you’re doing? take the bold steps and expose your gaps so that you would be able to fill it.

Familiar Tools: You are finding it difficult to estimate your work because your toolset and technology stack are changing so rapidly? learn to grow with technology.

Find Mentors: You find that you’re spending a lot of time reinventing wheels and hitting roadblocks? Look for a craftman which has had the experience before and follow his steps.

Kindred Spirits: Always fix yourself with people who have the same roadmap with you to share knowledge.

Learn How You Fail: Learn how you fail so that you would be able to learn from it.

Nurture Your Passion: You work in an environment that doesn't support your passion? leave and look for a place that supports your passion.
 
 Day 3
  I Studied the dynamics of war.
  The Ambitious Iraqi president Saddam Hussein wanted to reassert his country’s sovereignty over both banks of the Shaṭṭ al-ʿArab, a river formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that was historically the border between the two countries.So He made a move to seize control of the rich oil-producing Iranian border region of Khūzestān, a territory inhabited largely by ethnic Arabs over which Iraq sought to extend some form of suzerainty which led to the prolonged 1980-1988 military conflict between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s. Open warfare began on September 22, 1980, when Iraqi armed forces invaded western Iran along the countries’ joint border, though Iraq claimed that the war had begun earlier that month, on September 4, when Iran shelled a number of border posts. Fighting was ended by a 1988 cease-fire, though the resumption of normal diplomatic relations and the withdrawal of troops did not take place until the signing of a formal peace agreement on August 16, 1990.
  Then again in August 2 1990  Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, ordered the invasion and occupation of Kuwait with the apparent aim of acquiring that nation’s large oil reserves, canceling a large debt Iraq owed Kuwait, and expanding Iraqi power in the region. On August 3 the United Nations Security Council called for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and on August 6 the council imposed a worldwide ban on trade with Iraq. (The Iraqi government responded by formally annexing Kuwait on August 8.) Iraq’s invasion and the potential threat it then posed to Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer and exporter, prompted the United States and its western European NATO allies to rush troops to Saudi Arabia to deter a possible attack. Egypt and several other Arab nations joined the anti-Iraq coalition and contributed forces to the military buildup, known as Operation Desert Shield. Iraq meanwhile built up its occupying army in Kuwait to about 300,000 troops.
  After these wars Saddam Hussein was seen as a threat to the US which led to the Second Persian Gulf War, (2003–11), conflict in Iraq that consisted of two phases. The first of these was a brief, conventionally fought war in March–April 2003, in which a combined force of troops from the United States and Great Britain (with smaller contingents from several other countries) invaded Iraq and rapidly defeated Iraqi military and paramilitary forces. It was followed by a longer second phase in which a U.S.-led occupation of Iraq was opposed by an insurgency. After violence began to decline in 2007, the United States gradually reduced its military presence in Iraq, formally completing its withdrawal in December 2011.
