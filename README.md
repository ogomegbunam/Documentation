# Documentation on my first week in Finch Scoradia as an intent
    DAY 1
    I learnt the basics of project management and it's basics concepts which are
     1) Project-which is a temporal objective to profer a unique solution
     2) Poject cycle- which are different stages or processes of project management they are:
        a) initation-For initiation process group, you have 2 important processes;
           i)Project charter- This  is a fairly simple document outlining a few thingsit would include
             my objectives, scope, rough idea for the cost and time, key stakeholders and milestones.
           ii)Stakeholders identifiction-At this stage, you will again keep it very simple. You will not categorize all the stakeholder based on their influence it includes the Sponsors.
        b)Planning-Planning is a lot more detailed and comprehensive than initiation
          we are looking to find answers to 3 main questions;

           What are we going to do?

           How are we going to do it?

           How to know when the project is done? 
            So, it’ll include; requirements, and scope.

            Work Breakdown Structure (or as we call it WBS)
         c)Execution-The purpose of the executing process is to complete work we defined in the project management plan and meet the
          project objectives or in a Gantt chart,Gantt chart is a very easy way to list activities or work packages in a suitable
          timescale. Each work package or activity is represented by a bar and the position and length of the bar show us the start,
          duration, and end date of the activity.
         d) Management and Controlling-Monitoring and controlling means measuring the performance of your project against the plan, your             change requests, and making sure you are hitting your KPIs if you have included them in the plan.
         e) Closing-So, what do we do now?
           Well, what you do is really customizable to the needs and complexity of your project. But in general, these are 
           good starting points.

        One; We hand it over to the client if it’s a project you did for a client. You need to basically get a sign-off
            from the client.
        Two; Finish procurements. Meaning, you need to make the final payments and complete your cost records.
        Three; Gather your final lessons learned. This is basically documenting what went wrong and what 
              did we learn from it. You probably can’t see it on the camera, but this boat isn’t perfect. The bow of the boat is                       actually not straight. It’s leaning towards the port side, left side. Yeah a few lessons learned here.   
        Four; You release resources, let your team members go back to their own teams.
        five; finally… You're done.
